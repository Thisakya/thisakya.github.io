            <h2>Path Goal Theory</h2>
				<p>Path goal theory is based on the leader's style to see which suits the best for the employees and the work place in order to successfully achieve the desired organizational goals. The leader behaviours include four main types: directive, achievement-oriented, participative and supportive leader behavior.Directive behavior helps the employees to gain insight into the tasks. Achievement oriented behavior helps the organization achieve its milestones by giving challenges to the employees. Participative behavior involves the employees opinions when making decisions while, supportive leaders provide guidance for the employees to learn and complete given tasks.</p>
